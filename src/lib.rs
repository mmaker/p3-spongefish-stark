//! STARK proofs for simple hash-preimage relations.
//!
//! `spongefish-stark` allows to prove permutation statements via Plonky3 STARK proofs.
//!
//! Use cases include proving preimage of one or more hash invocations, while
//! revealing only the selected public outputs, inputs, or linear equations over them.
//! It can be useful for hash-based constructions such as commitments, encryption,
//! and Merkle-style structures.
//!
//! A relation can express that private inputs hash to a public commitment,
//! that values reused across hash calls are equal, or that linked hash invocations
//! form a larger computation such as a path or node update.
//!
//! The [`relation`] module provides the proving layer. Callers describe the
//! symbolic statement with `spongefish_circuit`'s
//! `PermutationInstanceBuilder`, provide matching private values with
//! `PermutationWitnessBuilder`, then use [`relation::PreparedRelation`] to
//! prove and verify the statement. The crate supplies ready-made
//! backends in [`permutation`] for Poseidon2 and Keccak-f[1600]; each backend
//! implements [`HashRelationBackend`] by bundling the Plonky3 configuration,
//! the hash AIR, and the executable permutation.
//!
//! # Lookup relation structure
//!
//! The relation uses three global lookups over `(variable id, value)` tuples.
//! The hash AIR proves each permutation and emits tuples. `in-out` balances
//! repeated private variables, so reused `FieldVar`s have one value.
//! `public-vars` matches public occurrences against declared assignments.
//! `linear-constraints` links a separate linear AIR, which checks sums locally,
//! back to the same hash values. Together they compose hash validity, public
//! openings, equality reuse, and linear relations.
